# Lynkmi Chrome Extension

Features:
- Cmd + B to bookmark the current tab (or press the extension icon)
- Twitter bookmark buttons get overridden by a Lynkmi bookmark instead too

Caveats/WIP:
- Uses an unstable unofficial API: https://github.com/venkr/lynkmi-api
- Unstyled UI so far - it'd be nice to use Lynkmi styling
- It'd be nicer to have a modal instead of a popup
